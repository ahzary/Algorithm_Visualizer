# Algorithm Visualizer

A user-friendly tool to visualize how map traversal algorithms work. Load your own custom Python algorithms, run simulations, and see them in action. Create your own maps or choose from a library of pre-built ones.



## Features

- ✅ Custom Algorithm Support – Load algorithms from the built-in library or your own Python scripts.
- ⏯️ Interactive Control – Pause and resume algorithms at any time to observe their behavior.
- 📊 Real-Time Analytics – Track explored nodes and step counts as the algorithm runs.
- 🗺️ Flexible Map Management – Import, export, and modify maps dynamically.
- ✏️ On-the-Fly Editing – Adjust maps with easy to use map editing tools.
